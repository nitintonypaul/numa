## 🔍 What Is NUMA?

NUMA is your soon-to-arrive browser sidekick, a sleek Chrome extension that transforms your default new-tab page into a distraction-eating, focus-boosting dashboard.
Think of it as your browser wearing noise-canceling headphones: all you hear is focus.

Or, if you prefer acronyms: **Neutral Utility for Maintaining Attention.**

> **Still in development.** Prototype pending – code is alive, but not quite breathing yet.
