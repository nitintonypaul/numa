## 🔍 What Is NUMA?

NUMA is your very own browser sidekick, a sleek Chrome extension that transforms your default new-tab page into a distraction-eating, focus-boosting dashboard. Think of it as your browser wearing noise-canceling headphones: all you hear is focus.

Or, if you prefer acronyms: **Neutral Utility for Maintaining Attention.**
